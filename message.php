 						<h2>Message from Principal</h2>
 						<p>The ultimate goal of education is to help an individual to lead a productive and well-balanced life while developing him/ her strong enough to give back to society. To achieve this goal Premier International IB World School goes beyond transferring facts, knowledge, and skills and works towards awakening the human soul, each unique yet beautiful manifestation of individuals of their own rights. Our school curricular activities are structured with the aim to develop world-class leaders who have a sense of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs. This value is well reflected in the involvement of the entire school community, students, teachers, staff and parents all alike, in community service actions, something we all are very proud of as a school team.</p>
 						<p>Radian Montessori School pioneers to take up groundbreaking vision to believe that adults are not the dictator of childrenâ€™s life but a part and partial of their living and growing environment. As adults, we unlearn, learn, and grow with our students and guide them to be the best version of themselves. I warmly welcome all the educators, parents, and students to Premier International IB World School and discover its progressive unique culture and character which is truly a 21 st century educational institution.
